Headline: Mastering the Fundamentals: Introducing Nexus Tab. 🚀 💻

Body: I’ve always believed that the tools we use daily should inspire us. That’s why I spent today building a "Best in Class" Chrome New Tab Theme from scratch.

Introducing Nexus Tab — a distraction-free, high-performance new tab experience.

Under the hood: I made a conscious decision to stick to the basics. No heavy frameworks, no complex build steps—just pure, optimized code.

Tech Stack: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Performance: Because there are zero dependencies, the load time is instant.

Design: Clean, modern, and designed to help you focus.

It’s a reminder that you don’t always need a complex stack to build beautiful software; sometimes, mastering the fundamentals is the most powerful tool.

How to use it? Since this is a custom developer tool, it's not on the store yet, but it's super easy to install!

Go to the GitHub repo below.

Read the README file for the simple 2-minute setup guide.

Enjoy a faster new tab!
